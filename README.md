# Project Overview

## Project Name

"World's 100 Billionaires "

## Project Description

"World's 100 Billionaires" begins with a About page that displays a description of the website. On the top of the page, it contains links to "About" and "Billionaires List" pages. If users visit or click "Billionaires List" page, they will see a list of 100 world's billionaires' with their pictures, names, net worth, rank and main sources of wealth in a descending order of rank (by their net worth).
